# Web Design Homework - Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)


## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

For this homework I created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations from a past assignment. 

I created individual pages for each plot and means to navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. There is also a landing page, a page where you can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where you can view the data I used to build them.

### Website

My website has 7 pages total:

* The landing page with:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page. There is a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking each image will take the user to that visualization.
* Four visualization pages, each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
* A Comparisons page that:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so you can easily visually compare them.
  * Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
* A Data page that:
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.

In addition, my website:

* Has the name of the site ('Latitude') on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
* Contains a dropdown menu on the right of the navbar named "Plots" that provides a link to each individual visualization page.
* Provides two more text links on the right: "Comparisons," which links to the comparisons page, and "Data," which links to the data page.
* Is responsive (using media queries).
